        "full_description": "In the winter of 1911-12, five Englishmen and five Norwegians raced each other to the bottom of the Earth. Only the Norwegians returned. Terra Nova is the story of Captain Scott’s expedition to the South Pole. The discovery that Amundsen has preceded him, the bravery and sufferings of his team, the self-sacrifice of Captain Oates and the final tragedy, are recounted in a mixture of fantasy and realism which underlines both the human and the epic qualities of the adventure. Terra Nova premiered at the Yale Rep in 1977 and its 1984 NYC production earned the writer an OBIE Award. The name is taken from the title of Captain Robert Scott’s ill-fated early 20th century, scientific expedition to the South Pole, whose name itself was taken from the whaling ship on which they travelled. Playwright, Ted Tally is perhaps best known for winning the 1992 OSCAR for Best Adapted Screen play of The Silence of the Lambs. ‘Terra Nova’ is the story of that fatal expedition, and of Scott’s the discovery that the Norwegian explorer Amundsen had beaten him to the Pole. It opens and closes with Scott writing the final entries in the journal from which all the details of his last weeks are known. The bravery and suffering of his team, climaxing in the famous self-sacrifice of Captain Oates and the final tragedy are recounted in a mixture of fantasy and realism. This is achieved by the conjured presence of Scott’s wife, Kathleen, and, – in a variety of guises – of Amundsen. The play is drawn from the journals and letters found on the frozen body of Captain Scott. Refusing the use of sled dogs as unsporting, Scott and his team struggle to drag their heavy gear across a frozen wasteland, only to find that Amundsen has preceded them to their goal. The play is also a study of British pride and upper-class resolve, Scott’s aristocratic sense of destiny and command, and his young bride’s ability to understand her husband’s compulsive drive while failing to accept his motivations. But it is in the tragic trip back, as the members of the expedition die one by one, that the play reaches its dramatic conclusion, capturing with chilling intensity the awesome bravery of men who must accept the bitter knowledge that suffering and death will be the only reward for their heroism.",

        "full_description": "In the winter of 1911-12, five Englishmen and five Norwegians raced each other to the bottom of the Earth. Only the Norwegians returned. Terra Nova is the story of Captain Scott’s expedition to the South Pole. The discovery that Amundsen has preceded him, the bravery and sufferings of his team, the self-sacrifice of Captain Oates and the final tragedy, are recounted in a mixture of fantasy and realism which underlines both the human and the epic qualities of the adventure. Terra Nova premiered at the Yale Rep in 1977 and its 1984 NYC production earned the writer an OBIE Award. The name is taken from the title of Captain Robert Scott’s ill-fated early 20th century, scientific expedition to the South Pole, whose name itself was taken from the whaling ship on which they travelled. Playwright, Ted Tally is perhaps best known for winning the 1992 OSCAR for Best Adapted Screen play of The Silence of the Lambs. ‘Terra Nova’ is the story of that fatal expedition, and of Scott’s the discovery that the Norwegian explorer Amundsen had beaten him to the Pole. It opens and closes with Scott writing the final entries in the journal from which all the details of his last weeks are known. The bravery and suffering of his team, climaxing in the famous self-sacrifice of Captain Oates and the final tragedy are recounted in a mixture of fantasy and realism. This is achieved by the conjured presence of Scott’s wife, Kathleen, and, – in a variety of guises – of Amundsen. The play is drawn from the journals and letters found on the frozen body of Captain Scott. Refusing the use of sled dogs as unsporting, Scott and his team struggle to drag their heavy gear across a frozen wasteland, only to find that Amundsen has preceded them to their goal. The play is also a study of British pride and upper-class resolve, Scott’s aristocratic sense of destiny and command, and his young bride’s ability to understand her husband’s compulsive drive while failing to accept his motivations. But it is in the tragic trip back, as the members of the expedition die one by one, that the play reaches its dramatic conclusion, capturing with chilling intensity the awesome bravery of men who must accept the bitter knowledge that suffering and death will be the only reward for their heroism.",

Playwright, Ted Tally is perhaps best known for winning the 1992 OSCAR for Best Adapted Screen play of The Silence of the Lambs. ‘Terra Nova’ is the story of that fatal expedition, and of Scott’s the discovery that the Norwegian explorer Amundsen had beaten him to the Pole. It opens and closes with Scott writing the final entries in the journal from which all the details of his last weeks are known. The bravery and suffering of his team, climaxing in the famous self-sacrifice of Captain Oates and the final tragedy are recounted in a mixture of fantasy and realism. This is achieved by the conjured presence of Scott’s wife, Kathleen, and, – in a variety of guises – of Amundsen. The play is drawn from the journals and letters found on the frozen body of Captain Scott. Refusing the use of sled dogs as unsporting, Scott and his team struggle to drag their heavy gear across a frozen wasteland, only to find that Amundsen has preceded them to their goal. The play is also a study of British pride and upper-class resolve, Scott’s aristocratic sense of destiny and command, and his young bride’s ability to understand her husband’s compulsive drive while failing to accept his motivations. But it is in the tragic trip back, as the members of the expedition die one by one, that the play reaches its dramatic conclusion, capturing with chilling intensity the awesome bravery of men who must accept the bitter knowledge that suffering and death will be the only reward for their heroism.",

        "full_description": "In the winter of 1911-12, five Englishmen and five Norwegians raced each other to the bottom of the Earth. Only the Norwegians returned. Terra Nova is the story of Captain Scott’s expedition to the South Pole. The discovery that Amundsen has preceded him, the bravery and sufferings of his team, the self-sacrifice of Captain Oates and the final tragedy, are recounted in a mixture of fantasy and realism which underlines both the human and the epic qualities of the adventure. Terra Nova premiered at the Yale Rep in 1977 and its 1984 NYC production earned the writer an OBIE Award. The name is taken from the title of Captain Robert Scott’s ill-fated early 20th century, scientific expedition to the South Pole, whose name itself was taken from the whaling ship on which they travelled. Playwright, Ted Tally is perhaps best known for winning the 1992 OSCAR for Best Adapted Screen play of The Silence of the Lambs. ‘Terra Nova’ is the story of that fatal expedition, and of Scott’s the discovery that the Norwegian explorer Amundsen had beaten him to the Pole. It opens and closes with Scott writing the final entries in the journal from which all the details of his last weeks are known. The bravery and suffering of his team, climaxing in the famous self-sacrifice of Captain Oates and the final tragedy are recounted in a mixture of fantasy and realism. This is achieved by the conjured presence of Scott’s wife, Kathleen, and, – in a variety of guises – of Amundsen. The play is drawn from the journals and letters found on the frozen body of Captain Scott. Refusing the use of sled dogs as unsporting, Scott and his team struggle to drag their heavy gear across a frozen wasteland, only to find that Amundsen has preceded them to their goal. The play is also a study of British pride and upper-class resolve, Scott’s aristocratic sense of destiny and command, and his young bride’s ability to understand her husband’s compulsive drive while failing to accept his motivations. But it is in the tragic trip back, as the members of the expedition die one by one, that the play reaches its dramatic conclusion, capturing with chilling intensity the awesome bravery of men who must accept the bitter knowledge that suffering and death will be the only reward for their heroism.",

        "full_description": "In the winter of 1911-12, five Englishmen and five Norwegians raced each other to the bottom of the Earth. Only the Norwegians returned. Terra Nova is the true story of Captain Scott’s expedition to the South Pole. The discovery that Amundsen has preceded him, the bravery and sufferings of his team, the self-sacrifice of Captain Oates and the final tragedy, are recounted in a mixture of fantasy and realism which underlines both the human and the epic qualities of the adventure. Terra Nova premiered at the Yale Rep in 1977 and its 1984 NYC production earned the writer an OBIE Award. The name is taken from the title of Captain Robert Scott’s ill-fated early 20th century, scientific expedition to the South Pole, whose name itself was taken from the whaling ship on which they travelled. Playwright, Ted Tally is perhaps best known for winning the 1992 OSCAR for Best Adapted Screen play of The Silence of the Lambs. ‘Terra Nova’ is the story of that fatal expedition, and of Scott’s the discovery that the Norwegian explorer Amundsen had beaten him to the Pole. It opens and closes with Scott writing the final entries in the journal from which all the details of his last weeks are known. The bravery and suffering of his team, climaxing in the famous self-sacrifice of Captain Oates and the final tragedy are recounted in a mixture of fantasy and realism. This is achieved by the conjured presence of Scott’s wife, Kathleen, and, – in a variety of guises – of Amundsen. The play is drawn from the journals and letters found on the frozen body of Captain Scott. Refusing the use of sled dogs as unsporting, Scott and his team struggle to drag their heavy gear across a frozen wasteland, only to find that Amundsen has preceded them to their goal. The play is also a study of British pride and upper-class resolve, Scott’s aristocratic sense of destiny and command, and his young bride’s ability to understand her husband’s compulsive drive while failing to accept his motivations. But it is in the tragic trip back, as the members of the expedition die one by one, that the play reaches its dramatic conclusion, capturing with chilling intensity the awesome bravery of men who must accept the bitter knowledge that suffering and death will be the only reward for their heroism.",

Because of Friday’s unique program, the club is welcoming spouses and outside guests to enjoy the performance in St. Mark’s Episcopal Church, 111 Oenoke Ridge, either in person, or online. The performance in the church is scheduled for 10:40 a.m., but it’s requested that guests arrive by 10:30 a.m.  The club will meet at its usual 10 a.m. time for its regular business in Morrill Hall, before adjourning to the church sanctuary for the musical performance and discussion. Yates, an accomplished pianist who has performed with internationally recognized musicians, such as violinist Midori, cellist David Finckel and pianist Gilbert Kalish, has led the symphony since its 2011-2012 season. He received his graduate degree in conducting from the Juilliard School and was the holder of the Bruno Walter Memorial Scholarship. He serves as music director emeritus of the chamber ensemble, Camerata Notturna in New York City. At the Symphony’s next performance, March 23, at 7:30 p.m. in Norwalk City Hall, the Music For All Ages concert includes George Gershwin’s “An American in Paris,” and Aaron Copland’s “Lincoln Portrait,” which will be narrated by Today Show Co-Host Craig Melvin. The Norwalk Symphony’s mission is to “share the beauty and power of orchestral music for audiences of all ages through live performances and music education.” Yates is also musical director and conductor of the Norwalk Youth Symphony, now in its 69th year, which performed in Italy last summer. Kitaychik has studied at the Moscow Conservatory and earned both her bachelor and master of music degrees from Mannes College of Music at The New School in New York. She received chamber music coaching from members of the Shostakovich Quartet, Borodin Quartet, and Orion String Quartet. In addition to attending the performance at the church, the Men’s Club is also making it available to the public online, by clicking the link, Norwalk Symphony at the New Canaan Men’s Club after 10:30am on February 21.

        "full_description": "In the winter of 1911-12, five Englishmen and five Norwegians raced each other to the bottom of the Earth. Only the Norwegians returned. Terra Nova is the story of Captain Scott’s expedition to the South Pole. The discovery that Amundsen has preceded him, the bravery and sufferings of his team, the self-sacrifice of Captain Oates and the final tragedy, are recounted in a mixture of fantasy and realism which underlines both the human and the epic qualities of the adventure. Terra Nova premiered at the Yale Rep in 1977 and its 1984 NYC production earned the writer an OBIE Award. The name is taken from the title of Captain Robert Scott’s ill-fated early 20th century, scientific expedition to the South Pole, whose name itself was taken from the whaling ship on which they travelled. Playwright, Ted Tally is perhaps best known for winning the 1992 OSCAR for Best Adapted Screen play of The Silence of the Lambs. ‘Terra Nova’ is the story of that fatal expedition, and of Scott’s the discovery that the Norwegian explorer Amundsen had beaten him to the Pole. It opens and closes with Scott writing the final entries in the journal from which all the details of his last weeks are known. The bravery and suffering of his team, climaxing in the famous self-sacrifice of Captain Oates and the final tragedy are recounted in a mixture of fantasy and realism. This is achieved by the conjured presence of Scott’s wife, Kathleen, and, – in a variety of guises – of Amundsen. The play is drawn from the journals and letters found on the frozen body of Captain Scott. Refusing the use of sled dogs as unsporting, Scott and his team struggle to drag their heavy gear across a frozen wasteland, only to find that Amundsen has preceded them to their goal. The play is also a study of British pride and upper-class resolve, Scott’s aristocratic sense of destiny and command, and his young bride’s ability to understand her husband’s compulsive drive while failing to accept his motivations. But it is in the tragic trip back, as the members of the expedition die one by one, that the play reaches its dramatic conclusion, capturing with chilling intensity the awesome bravery of men who must accept the bitter knowledge that suffering and death will be the only reward for their heroism.",

Registration is now open for The Community Fund of Darien’s Spring Semester of Youth Give Back (YGB), a volunteer youth program for 7th and 8th grade students in Darien. Through YGB, students volunteer with local nonprofit organizations such as Fairgate Farm, Person to Person, Open Doors Shelter, At Home in Darien, and Darien Nature Center. Student volunteers gain hands-on experience addressing critical human service needs in the community while making a meaningful impact. “This program introduces Darien students to the power of volunteerism and opens their eyes to the challenges faced by individuals in our community,” says Sarah McCarty, Thriving Youth Program Director. “One YGB student shared, ‘I learned that acts of kindness can change lives and impact many.’” Last semester, 18 Darien students participated in six local volunteer opportunities. A standout experience for many was time spent at Waveny LifeCare Network in New Canaan, where students connected with residents through engaging activities. Waveny’s Executive Director of Community Engagement, Stella Clarke, shared, “Our residents enjoyed YGB’s visit so much, and many staff members commented on the happy smiles, laughter, and conversation. It was especially nice that having all the extra pairs of hands we were able to bring many of our 50 residents out into the garden to spend time enjoying the sunshine and leaves. The students really engaged well and were kind and friendly with good questions after the activity.” Applications are due January 6, 2024, and can be submitted via the student Google form available on The Community Fund of Darien’s website: communityfunddarien.org/ youthgiveback .

Terra Nova is the true story of Captain Scott’s expedition to the South Pole. The discovery that Amundsen has preceded him, the bravery and sufferings of his team, the self-sacrifice of Captain Oates and the final tragedy, are recounted in a mixture of fantasy and realism which underlines both the human and the epic qualities of the adventure. Terra Nova premiered at the Yale Rep in 1977 and its 1984 NYC production earned the writer an OBIE Award. The name is taken from the title of Captain Robert Scott’s ill-fated early 20th century, scientific expedition to the South Pole, whose name itself was taken from the whaling ship on which they travelled. Playwright, Ted Tally is perhaps best known for winning the 1992 OSCAR for Best Adapted Screen play of The Silence of the Lambs. ‘Terra Nova’ is the story of that fatal expedition, and of Scott’s the discovery that the Norwegian explorer Amundsen had beaten him to the Pole. It opens and closes with Scott writing the final entries in the journal from which all the details of his last weeks are known. The bravery and suffering of his team, climaxing in the famous self-sacrifice of Captain Oates and the final tragedy are recounted in a mixture of fantasy and realism. This is achieved by the conjured presence of Scott’s wife, Kathleen, and, – in a variety of guises – of Amundsen. The play is drawn from the journals and letters found on the frozen body of Captain Scott. Refusing the use of sled dogs as unsporting, Scott and his team struggle to drag their heavy gear across a frozen wasteland, only to find that Amundsen has preceded them to their goal. The play is also a study of British pride and upper-class resolve, Scott’s aristocratic sense of destiny and command, and his young bride’s ability to understand her husband’s compulsive drive while failing to accept his motivations. But it is in the tragic trip back, as the members of the expedition die one by one, that the play reaches its dramatic conclusion, capturing with chilling intensity the awesome bravery of men who must accept the bitter knowledge that suffering and death will be the only reward for their heroism.",

In a talk titled “When Science Goes Wrong: The Desire and Search for the Truth,” Br. Consolmagno’s comments will focus on the history of science ideas once considered reasonable before being proven wrong. The Men’s Club meeting is scheduled for 10 a.m. with Br. Consolmagno’s remarks set for 10:40 a.m. He holds degrees from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and a Ph.D. from the University of Arizona’s Lunar and Planetary Laboratory. He currently is the president of the Vatican Observatory Foundation  and is the recipient of the Carl Sagan Medal of Excellence for Public Communication in Planetary Science. He is the author or co-author of several books, among them “Turn Left at Orion,” “God’s Mechanics, How Scientists and Engineers Make Sense of Religion,” and “Would You Baptize and Extraterrestial,” which draws upon questions sent to the Vatican. In his presentation, “When Science Goes Wrong,” Br. Consolmagno will explore the unpredictable nature of scientific discovery, the role of failure in advancing knowledge, and how unexpected results can lead to groundbreaking insights. Drawing from his extensive experience in planetary studies, his work with the Vatican Observatory, and his lifelong passion for exploring the cosmos, he will offer his perspective on the dynamic and sometimes messy nature of scientific progress. The Men’s Club has openings for men 55-years old and above. For information, email ncmens@ncmens.club.",

After a brief grounding meditation, amidst the glowing landscape at the Carriage Barn, you’ll be enveloped in a symphony of harmonious vibrations, produced by an assortment of crystal and Himalayan singing bowls, chimes, gongs, drums and more. The gentle hum of the instruments creates a sensory experience that transcends the boundaries of the physical world. Allow the sounds to penetrate deep into your being, dissolving tension, and promoting inner calm and balance. You’ll find yourself drifting effortlessly into a state of deep relaxation, where time seems to stand still and the worries of the day melt away. Let the music guide you as you explore the depths of your consciousness, finding solace and renewal in the stillness within. As the sound bath draws to a close, we’ll wrap up with a body scan and some breath work to leave you  feeling refreshed, rejuvenated, and deeply connected to yourself and the world around you. Emerge from this transformative experience with a sense of peace and serenity as you step back into the outside world, ready to face whatever lies ahead with clarity and grace. Sound Baths have been shown to reduce stress and anxiety; improve sleep; help with depression; lower blood pressure  and bring on an overall sense of calm and inner peace.

If he doesn't improve the plant's performance, corporate headquarters will close it down and hundreds of workers will lose their jobs. It takes a chance meeting with Jonah, a former professor, to help him break out of his conventional thinking and figure out what needs to be done. As Alex identifies the plant's problems and works with his team to find solutions, the reader gains an understanding of the fundamental concepts behind the Theory of Constraints.",

        "description": "Widely listed as one of the best books of 2024, tells the 93-year-old history of Crownsville Hospital, one of the last segregated asylums with surviving records and a campus that still stands in Anne Arundel County, Maryland. Award-winning journalist Antonia Hylton traces the legacy of slavery to the treatment of Black people’s bodies and minds in our current mental healthcare system. It is a captivating and heartbreaking meditation on how America decides who is sick or criminal, and who is worthy of our care or irredeemable. Hylton will be in conversation with former ABC News Correspondent and Anchor Heather Cabot. On a cold day in March of 1911, officials marched twelve Black men into the heart of a forest in Maryland. Under the supervision of a doctor, the men were forced to clear the land, pour cement, lay bricks, and harvest tobacco. They became the first twelve patients of the state’s Hospital for the Negro Insane, later called Crownsville Hospital. As Crownsville Hospital grew from an antebellum-style work camp to a tiny city sitting on 1,500 acres, the institution became a microcosm of America’s evolving battles over slavery, racial integration, and civil rights. This program is co-sponsored by LiveGirl and New Canaan Library. Antonia Hylton is a Peabody and Emmy-award winning journalist at NBC News reporting on politics and civil rights, and the co-host of the hit podcasts Southlake and Grapevine. She graduated magna cum laude from Harvard University, where she received prizes for her investigative research on race, mass incarceration and the history of psychiatry. She lives in Brooklyn.

Laser cutter material will be limited to cardboard and scarps of wood. Cricut Cutting Machine: We'll have a featured project to try on the Cricut or you can use the Cricut software or Inkscape to create your own designs.
