          "full_text": "As part of our exciting new Art in the Park initiative, the Conservancy welcomed its third\n\nsculpture, \u201cClunie Spiral\u201d, to Waveny Park on Thursday, November 7th. The new sculpture has been placed near the top of the sledding hill leading to Anderson Pond, along the edge where the Lapham\u2019s old swimming pool was installed. A permanent base still needs to be installed and final positioning tweaked but delivery and unloading went smoothly thanks to our New Canaan town partners at the Parks and Recreation and Highway Departments. \u00a0\u201cClunie Spiral\u201d is generously donated by Kathy Megrue-Smith. A formal unveiling and dedication is planned for the future.\n\n\u201cClunie Spiral\u201d is the third in a series of\n\nplanned for the Park. Sculpted by the Scottish artist, Nigel Ross, the first two sculptures arrived at the Park in early 2024 as part of a long-term plan for select organic outdoor sculptures. \u201cCrossways\u201d sits on the knoll at the north end of Jeniam Meadow and \u201cArbor\u201d borders the lawn and Upper Meadow at the back of the house. While Ross has a couple of his sculptures in the United States, the Park\u2019s plan for a\n\nconsisting of a total of five of Ross\u2019s sculptures is unique. \u00a0As functional art, they\n\nare designed to be sat and climbed on and we encourage you to bring your children to experience them. All three sculptures are approximately 11 to 12 feet long and weigh half to three quarters of a ton.\n\nWe are grateful for the efforts of our former board member and colleague, Charles Crookenden, who worked tirelessly to bring the\n\nprogram to Waveny. A fourth sculpture is already on order as a tribute to him.\n\nWoodlands restoration is underway!\n\nYour financial contribution to the Waveny Park Conservancy is essential in helping to fund one of New Canaan\u2019s most beloved parks.",

The race will once again take place at New Canaan High School and will be run through the idyllic Waveny Park in New Canaan. This race seeks to build community through raising funds to provide weekend meals for children facing food insecurity in local neighborhoods.\n\nRaising $35,338 with 249 participants, the race exceeded all expectations in 2021 and helped expand our program to assist 116 more children with a year\u2019s worth of weekend meals! This year you have the unique opportunity to get in early as a staple sponsor of this event, which will benefit your brand, and help us continue to grow that success to do even more!\n\nIn Fairfield County, more than 33,000 children are not sure where their next meal will come from. Most will get breakfast and lunch from school every weekday, but many will go from Friday lunch until Monday at breakfast without a decent meal. Filling in the Blanks is an organization that fills in those weekend gaps by providing each child in its program with a backpack filled with healthy food for the weekend. When the obstacle of food insecurity is removed, children experience increased academic achievement in school and greater opportunities for success in their lives.\n\nFounded in 2013 by two Fairfield County residents, Tina Kramer and Shawnee Knight, Filling in the Blanks is a 501c3 non-profit organization that has grown from serving 50 kids to serving more than 4,000 kids in Fairfield and Westchester counties.\n\nThe Unite to Fight 5K event was inspired through the memory of Kristen Reynolds Ruth, a local kindergarten teacher, mother and friend, who passed in 2011 after a 7-year battle with cancer and was deeply passionate about working with and helping children. The event was created and is directed by her daughter, an NCHS alumni, Britt Gardella.\n\nWITH YOUR EVENT REGISTRATION, YOU WILL RECEIVE THE FOLLOWING:\n\nUnite to Fight 5K T-shirt, available for local pick up the week of the race.*\n\nGift certificates for top three men and women race finishers\n\nUnite to Fight 5K medals for age group winners\n\n*Participants registering after August 10th 2022 may not receive a shirt.\n\nREGISTER\n\nTown Hall\n\n77 Main Street\n\nNew Canaan, CT 06840\n\n(203) 594-3000\n\n(203) 594-3123",

          "full_text": "The Y will introduce new programs for kids, teens, and adults providing opportunities for all ages to grow, learn something new, and join in on the fun at the Y this fall.\n\nRegistration for fall programs is currently available online and at the Y. Fall programs range in session length and begin Wednesday, August 30. Several programs are open to both members and non-members of the New Canaan YMCA, with members receiving a program discount as a benefit of their membership. Financial assistance for membership and program fees is also available thanks to donations to the Y.\n\nIn addition to the popular returning programs such as swim lessons, Bouncing Bears gymnastics, and youth sports and wellness programs, the Y is excited to launch new youth recreation and Red Cross certification programs.\n\nNew recreation programs for preschoolers include Lunch Bunch and the Dino Den, as well as a Let\u2019s Build: Legos class for children in kindergarten through third grade. The Y\u2019s weekly lunch bunch group will feature a variety of games and activities including STEM, music and movement, puppet making, and more. Dino Den is an enriching program that will teach children all about dinosaurs including a weekly dino of the day in addition to fun activities and educational videos. The Y\u2019s Lego-building class is designed for kids to explore creative Lego themes and will provide guided group builds and individual builds that will keep kids engaged while learning teamwork and having fun.\n\nThe Y\u2019s recreation department will also debut several middle school programs this fall including percussion, music, and crafting classes where participants can hone skills, learn something new, and make friends. The Y\u2019s percussion program will introduce middle schoolers to the unique beats and rhythms of drumming using a diverse array of percussion instruments. Aspiring middle school musicians may also partake in the Y\u2019s music class which will introduce folk music, acapella, body percussion, guitar, and banjo. The Y\u2019s master crafters class inspires creativity through creating projects including nature mobiles, suncatchers, and 3D name plates, in addition to learning the concepts of perspective, color theory, and negative space.\n\nThe Y will also be introducing additional safety certification courses this fall. In addition to the Junior Lifeguarding Course available to ages 11-14 and the Red Cross Babysitting course available to ages 11-15, new courses will be offered to teens and adults in the community. These courses include Red Cross First Aid, CPR, & AED Training for ages 12-17, and Red Cross Safety Training for Swim Coaches, Red Cross Basic Life Support Training for Healthcare & Public Safety, and Red Cross First Aid, CPR, AED, & Opioid Overdose Training for the Professional Rescuer for ages 16 and older. The Y will also offer a First Aid, CPR, & AED Training course for ages 18 and older. Each course is a one-day program and is open to New Canaan YMCA members and the community.\n\nKids and teens looking to find their team or try something new this fall can participate in tryouts for the Y\u2019s Whirlwind Diving and Caimans Swim teams\u2019 upcoming fall seasons. The Whirlwind Diving team is currently hosting try-outs through Friday, August 25 from 3:00-6:00 PM at the Y. Those interested in scheduling a try-out for the Whirlwind Diving team can contact Adam Vance, Associate Competitive Diving Director, at 203-920-1658 or\n\n.

In addition to the LIVESTRONG at the YMCA cancer survivor program, Diabetes Prevention Program (DPP), and as an addition to its current programming for those with Parkinson\u2019s Disease, the Y will be introducing Pedaling for Parkinson\u2019s this fall. Riding an indoor stationary bicycle has been shown to reduce Parkinson\u2019s motor symptoms by as much as 35%, and it\u2019s something that almost anyone with Parkinson\u2019s disease can do. The Y\u2019s Pedaling for Parkinson\u2019s program is designed to offer an hour ride on an indoor stationary bike starting with a 10-minute warm-up, 40 minutes with resistance, and a 10-minute cool-down. Those interested in learning more about the program can contact Eva Saint, New Canaan YMCA Wellness Director, to learn more at 203-920-1623 or\n\n.\n\nA complete listing of fall programming is available online at www.newcanaanymca.org.

          "full_text": "The New Canaan YMCA and New Canaan Parks and Recreation Department are thrilled to share the culmination of a successful first-year partnership providing nearly 200 kids in our community with swim lessons at the Steve Benko Pool in Waveny Park.\n\nFive mornings per week at the Steve Benko Pool, New Canaan YMCA swim instructors taught children ages six months through twelve years old and focused on safety, confidence, and strength in the water in a fun and nurturing environment.\n\nWhile children learned the important skill of swimming, their parents and caregivers learned about safety in and out of the water. According to the CDC, drowning is the leading cause of death for children ages one to four and the second leading cause of death for children ages five to fourteen. The Y\u2019s swim lesson program incorporated a weekly water safety lesson for parents and caregivers during swim lessons. Water Safety Wednesdays, led by Matt Busse, New Canaan YMCA Director of Aquatic Operations & Safety, taught parents and caregivers pool and beach safety, aquatic emergency preparedness, and hands-only CPR lessons that provide life-saving skills far beyond the summer.\n\n\u201cWe are very proud to have partnered with the Parks and Recreation Department on this initiative. In addition to helping 200 kids become safer and stronger in the water, our summer swim lessons at the Steve Benko pool were an excellent example of how a community nonprofit and the Town can join in partnership to further our common goal of serving our community members. The Y is always exploring ways to expand our services and we look forward to future partnerships,\u201d shared Margaret Riley, New Canaan YMCA Executive Director.\n\nZack Philippas, Assistant Director of New Canaan Parks and Recreation, shared, \u201cOur goal here at New Canaan Recreation is to provide recreational, educational, and social programs for all New Canaan Residents. Partnering with a reputable organization such as the YMCA of New Canaan has given us the opportunity to offer quality swim lessons while maximizing the usage of Steve Benko Pool. We are already looking forward to next season!\u201d\n\nTo learn more about the Y\u2019s swim lessons program, visit\n\n. To learn more about the New Canaan Recreation Department, visit\n\n.",

The Carriage Barn and Powerhouse were built during this period. In 1904, Lewis Henry Lapham, a co-founder of the Texaco Oil Company, bought the property as a summer estate from Hall, and expanded it from 280 acres to 450 acres.\n\nLapham tore down Hall's house and had a new one built in 1912 by the renowned architect William B. Tubby of Greenwich. The new house was named Waveny House after Waveny River in England where Lapham ancestors had once lived. The landscape design for the property was by the Olmsted Brothers Firm, sons of Frederick Law Olmsted, Jr., who designed Central Park. The house sits majestically overlooking hundreds of acres of immaculate gardens and grounds.\n\nIn August of 1967, the Town of New Canaan purchased Waveny Park from Mrs. Ruth Lapham Lloyd, the daughter of Lewis Lapham Lloyd. The House is the centerpiece of an outstanding community recreation area enjoyed by the residents of the Town. It is open to the public and may be rented for a variety of functions through the New Canaan Recreation Department, which is located on the second floor of the House. The first floor of Waveny House consists of the grand hall, the library, sitting room, dining/breakfast room, billiard room, a patio which overlooks the beautiful grounds, and a complete commercial kitchen. On the second floor are four gracious rooms which are used for conferences and meetings.\n\nLewis Henry Lapham\n\nRuth Lapham Lloyd\n\nThe park is bordered by Farm Road to the North, the Merritt Parkway to the South, South Avenue to the East and Lapham Road to the West. Over the years, numerous additional structures have been built or re-purposed on parts of the property. The park contains approximately 3.5 miles of jogging/walking trails, soccer, baseball and softball fields, picnic areas, Waveny Park Swimming Facility, artificial turf Water Tower Field and lots of open space. Waveny Park also contains the PowerHouse Performing Arts Center, The Carriage Barn Art Center, Spencer's Run Dog Park, Lapham Community Center and The Waveny Lodge and Platform Tennis Courts.\n\nSign up with your email address to receive news and updates.\n\nWe respect your privacy.",

          "full_text": "Written by Kole Bavoso, NCPS Communications Intern\n\nThis past weekend, the New Canaan High School\u2019s Theatre Department performed their Spring production\u2014Rodgers and Hammerstein\u2019s Cinderella. The musical follows the story of Ella [Annabelle Murphy] who is forced into being subservient to her villainous stepmother, Madame [Kole Bavoso]. Ella wishes she could go out and explore the world. Revolutionary Jean-Michel [Thomas Pisant] tries to open the peoples\u2019 eyes to injustice in their kingdom while Lord Pinkleton [Hank Durfee] announces Prince Topher\u2019s [Bennett Gropper] ball to find a queen. Aided by her fairy godmother, Marie [Hannah Reid], Ella transforms out of her rags and into a beautiful gown and meets the Prince at the ball. The two share a kiss. Madame tries to persuade Lord Protector Sebastian [Nick Mohamad] into having one of her daughters, the beautiful Gabrielle [Catherine Haddad], meet the Prince and become Queen. Madame\u2019s other daughter, Charlotte [Sophie Jones], laments the fact that her sister is always the one guys are drawn to.\n\nThe show featured many Seniors performing in their final production at New Canaan High School, one of which being Kole Bavoso. Kole played the part of Madame and had such an incredible time working on the show. Cinderella was the first show where Kole played the antagonist, offering a very different experience to their repertoire. Kole admits, \u201cIt was difficult to play someone as mean and terrifying as Madame. But with the help of our director, every day I felt more confident in my role.\u201d Kole even said that, as they got closer to the show, they began to take more risks with their character, which ultimately paid off comedically. \u201cI remember adding in small moments that gave Madame more character, like adding in an evil laugh after a line or throwing my cloak at Ella.\u201d These small details, Kole notes, made this role an unforgettable experience.\n\nThis production was one of the biggest the New Canaan High School auditorium saw this year. \u201cIt was really satisfying to look out into the audience from the stage and see hundreds of people smiling back at you,\u201d remarks Kole. \u201cThe energy of an audience is a big part of the excitement of performing, so\u2014when there is a big audience\u2014us actors feel so much enthusiasm on stage.\u201d\n\nKole admits that it was difficult to replicate the overwhelmingly positive reception the underclassmen Fall musical Mean Girls received. But Cinderella attracted an audience of all different ages, from little kids wearing their Cinderella gowns all the way to parents and grandparents watching their young thespian on stage. The show was such an enjoyable and entertaining experience that drew in people from not only New Canaan, but all over the Fairfield County area.\n\nThe production was directed by Matt Blank, choreographed by Emily Frangipane, and music directed by Henry Tate\u2014a Junior at New Canaan High School. Henry was ecstatic to music direct Cinderella, being the first student to ever do so. Henry usually can be seen on stage as an actor, most recently starring as Robert Martin in The Drowsy Chaperone at New Canaan High School. Adding to a successful young acting career, Henry Tate decided he wanted to see what else theater has to offer him. While serving as assistant music director, he \u201creally enjoyed the experience of being more involved.\u201d\n\nAs someone who has always been involved with music, Henry said, \u201cI\u2019ve really enjoyed combining my longtime love for playing piano with theatre. The two coming together has been really gratifying.\u201d As music director, he had many responsibilities\u2014teaching the cast their lyrics, and melodies, cleaning long sections of singing, and playing the piano as accompaniment during rehearsals. Henry spent many hours every week helping the cast on and off stage and has tackled this huge feat very thoroughly. \u201cThere is so much that goes into being the music director that I never even imagined,\u201d Henry shares, \u201cputting all the intricate details of this show together has felt like a huge accomplishment.\u201d\n\nThe cast is very thankful for Henry and all that he did to prepare them for the incredible show they put on. With the seniors off to college next year, the Juniors now step up as the next leaders in the department. Henry will certainly be ready for any responsibilities thrown his way this coming year, whether he is acting on the stage or music directing again.\n\nPhoto Contributions by Henry Tate",

          "full_text": "Repost from\n\n, 'They've Carried on Our Culture': New Canaan Girls Lacross Beat Darien for CIAC LL Title.\" by Terry Dinan | June 9, 2024\n\nIt was a lot of d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu all over again at Sacred Heart University\u2019s Campus Field on Saturday afternoon.\n\nFor the third consecutive year it was New Canaan-Darien in the CIAC Girls Lacrosse Championship. The same matchup as it has been for the previous four FCIAC Championship Games. And just like the conference final played 16 days ago, it was the Rams who came away with a five-goal win as New Canaan downed the top-seeded Blue Wave 10-5 to take the Class LL crown.\n\n\u201cI am just so happy for this team,\u201d New Canaan head coach Kristin Woods said. \u201cThey worked their butts off all season. I kept telling them practice is going to be harder than game, and it paid off.\u201d\n\nHelped by a standout performance from junior goalie Ceci Patterson (8 saves), a stout defensive performance and long offensive possessions that usually ended with scores, the No. 2-seeded Rams reeled off six consecutive goals to turn a 3-2 nail-biter at the end of the first period into a comfortable 9-2 lead heading into the game\u2019s final minutes. Darien\u2019s Anna Van Kennel scored three goals in the last 2:30 of the contest to keep the Blue Wave\u2019s hopes alive \u2013 but it was too little, too late.\n\n\u201cMaintaining possession on the draws was super important,\u201d senior co-captain Devon Russell said. \u201cWe had Kat Norton and Lexie Tully try it and we were successful switching that up against (Darien\u2019s) Sadie Stafford who was doing great on the draw.\u201d\n\n\u201cI think defensively we stopped the break \u2013 they scored two quick ones off breaks,\u201d Woods told\n\n. \u201cThey just played together and that\u2019s the best part about this team. There is no one kid that is going to do it all. Every single person was a weapon out there.\u201d\n\nAs they have all season, the Rams showed remarkable patience on the offensive end\u2014not forcing bad shots and relying on ball control, movement and forcing Darien to make mistakes, resulting in numerous eight-meter free position opportunities. New Canaan received goals from six different players \u2013 Emma Row, Maddie Tully, Lexie Tully, Devon Russell, Sydney Patten and Addie Crowley \u2013 with Row, both Tully sisters and Russell leading the way with two scores apiece.\n\nThe win was New Canaan\u2019s eighth state championship (2010, 2012, 2013, 2015, 2016, 2018, 2022, 2024) and marks the second time in program history that the Rams captured both the FCIAC and CIAC titles (2022 being the other). The victory erased not only the bad memories of last year\u2019s state final (won by Darien 14-13) but also a 5-5 tie with the Wave back on April 25\n\n.\n\n\u201cWe knew that tie earlier in the season definitely wasn\u2019t our best game,\u201d Russell said, \u201cThe fact that we tied them and knew we had a lot to work on was really encouraging. We implemented that in that FCIAC game and to come back here and play them again we knew it was probably going to be the toughest time we had with them. Just maintaining that idea of \u2018we\u2019re not done yet,\u2019 we need to keep applying what we\u2019re doing, not being satisfied \u2013 that is what really motivated us.\u201d\n\nFor Russell and the rest of her senior teammates, winning both FCIAC and State titles over their rival was a fitting coda to a very special class of lacrosse players \u2014 one in which seven members are going on to play lacrosse in college.\n\n\u201cTo be able to end our career at New Canaan on such a high note is so special,\u201d Russell said. \u201cWe know how good we were individually, the talent is there. The main thing we wanted to represent about New Canaan as a town and as a team is that it is all about each other. It\u2019s all about your teammates \u2013 every ground ball, every defensive stop you make you\u2019re doing it for each other and that embodies the New Canaan mentality.\u201d\n\n\u201cThis group has come together since freshman year and they left it on the field,\u201d Woods said. \u201cThe senior leaders have just been outstanding, every single one of them has meant so much to the program. They\u2019ve carried on our culture. I know they\u2019re going to go on to do amazing things and will accomplish so much at the next level.\u201d\n\nPhoto Credit: Terry Dinan, Contributed to",

Currently, South Elementary School is the first educational institution in the state of CT to receive a Moon Tree seedling and will use this opportunity to promote science, technology, engineering and math within its classrooms.\n\n\u201c...[This] is an exciting moment in the history of space exploration,\u201d stated Gabriella Brown, Science Teacher at South Elementary School. \u201cFor the first time in nearly 50 years, NASA is planning to return to the Moon, and to commemorate this new era of moon exploration they sent seeds to honor Stuart Roosa\u2019s Moon Tree experiment from the Apollo 14 mission. I thought this would be a great opportunity to foster citizenship by connecting our children with the natural world and outer space by encouraging them to become environmental stewards and citizen scientists.\u201d\n\nOn August 24, 2023, NASA announced that their NASA Next Gen STEM Department, in partnership with the USDA Forest Service, will begin accepting applications for education and community organizations to receive a living piece of spaceflight history. This piece of history will be in the form of one of 50 seedlings grown from a tree seed aboard NASA\u2019s Artemis I mission. Each seed traveled thousands of miles beyond the Moon and spent four weeks in space before returning back to Earth. The mission, completed in late 2022, continues the original The Moon Tree project launched in 1971 when seeds were sent into space to study the effects of prolonged weightlessness on germination.\n\n\u201cNASA\u2019s Artemis moon trees are bringing the science and ingenuity of space exploration back down to Earth,\u201d said NASA Administrator Bill Nelson in the NASA-issued press release on April 24. \u201cLast year, these seeds flew on the Artemis I mission 40,000 miles beyond the Moon. With the help of the USDA, this new generation of Moon trees will plant the spirit of exploration across our communities and inspire the next generation of explorers.\u201d\n\nOver 1300 applications were submitted to NASA for review, with the first batch of trees sent to nearly 50 institutions nationwide. Recipients were chosen based on their tree care plans and proposals for implementation in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics. Those selected would be eligible to receive one of five species of trees grown on the 2022 Artemus I flight, including sycamores, sweetgum, Douglas firs, loblolly pines, and giant sequoias.\n\nIn mid-April, South Elementary School was notified they had been selected as one of the first organizations to receive a seedling and is the first institution in CT to be a Moon Tree Steward. The sycamore tree seedling was received on April 26 and planted the following day, on Arbor Day, on the grounds of South Elementary School.\n\n\u201cWe have many exciting plans to incorporate the Moon Tree into our student\u2019s education across the district,\u201d said Brown. \u201cThe beauty is that this journey can be applied in all subjects from data collection in math, to poetry in ELA, the history of moon exploration in social studies, exploring the seasonal growth changes in science, and much more. We\u2019re looking forward to the development of a creative space in which children of all abilities can apply classroom lessons to create something real that is valued by others.\u201d",

          "full_text": "New Canaan Public Schools is proud to announce the grand opening of its highly anticipated immersive learning theater, The Dome, at New Canaan High School. The official ribbon-cutting ceremony took place on April 30th in a private event held with members of the Board of Education, The Dome Committee, Ad Council, PTC/PFA, and town officials, including current First Selectman Dionna Carlson and former First Selectman Kevin Moynihan.\n\nThe Dome, a cutting-edge immersive and interactive learning theater, now stands in the place of NCHS' original 1971 planetarium. The space has undergone a remarkable transformation, boasting a 30-ft, ceiling-mounted circular theater screen, dual 4K Sony projector system, LED cove lighting, and cinema-style seating. The Dome also features a state-of-the-art programming system, Digistar 7, which provides a breadth of educational experiences across various disciplines, including biology, astrology, mathematics, physics, history, art, and more. Together, these features blend visuals and sound to create a breathtaking 180-degree image, revolutionizing traditional education into a fully immersive visual, audio, and sensory experience.\n\n\"We are deeply appreciative of everyone who has been a part of this inspiring project,\" expressed Superintendent Dr. Bryan Luizzi. \"It has been an extraordinary journey, and we are grateful for the unwavering support and dedication of those who have helped turn this vision into a reality.\"\n\nThe vision to transform the former planetarium into a new, modern learning center was first conceived in 2016, but plans were put on hold due to the COVID-19 pandemic. However, through a collaborative private-public fundraising initiative between the town and community members, the district revived the project in 2022. In recognition of the support and contributions from community members, the entrance to The Dome is adorned with a wall of dedication stars, each symbolizing the generous donations of New Canaan community members who played a pivotal role in turning the vision of the space into reality. Led by community member and NCPS alumni, Sara Schubert, The Dome's Committee was instrumental in driving the project forward, demonstrating the power of community in realizing ambitious educational visions.\n\n\"The Dome is a powerful example of what's possible when we come together as a community on behalf of our children,\" stated Superintendent Dr. Bryan Luizzi. \"In a world that's driving us to look down at our small screens, isolated and alone, The Dome brings us together to share in a sense of wonder and awe. Instead of looking down and thinking small, The Dome provides a vast canvas with infinite possibilities for all of us to explore the world together in previously unimaginable ways.\"\n\nThe Dome is currently open for classroom use for grades K-12, with public use expected in Fall 2024.",
